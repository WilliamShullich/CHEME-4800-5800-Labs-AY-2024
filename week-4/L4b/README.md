# `Lab 4b`: Build a Software Development Kit for the National Weather Service API
In `Lab 4b` students will build a Software Development Kit (SDK) for the [National Weather Service API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api). 

## Prerequisite 
Break up into teams of 2-3 people and take `5 min` to walk through all the files (starting with `Include.jl` in the `root` directory) in `Lab-4b`. At the end of `5 min`, we'll do a class Q&A to ensure everyone understands the purpose of each file.
